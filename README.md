# Number Parser

In this challenge we want to convert a string into an integer. The strings simply represent the numbers in words.

## Examples:

"one" => 1
"twenty" => 20
"two hundred forty-six" => 246
"seven hundred eighty-three thousand nine hundred and nineteen" => 783919

## Additional Notes:

The minimum number is "zero" (inclusively)
The maximum number, which must be supported is 1 million (inclusively)
The "and" in e.g. "one hundred and twenty-four" is optional, in some cases it's present and in others it's not
All tested numbers are valid, you don't need to validate them

## Using the tests

Some example tests have already been created for you. You only need make them
pass. You can get started by running the following commands:

1) Clone the repo: `git clone git@github.com:wvmitchell/number-parser.git`
2) Move in and install dependencies: `cd number-parser && npm i`
3) Run the tests: `npm test`
4) Alternatively, run the tests in watch mode: `npm run test:watch`
5) Make the first test pass, then move on to the first skipped test

## Important notes
1) Other than unskipping tests, you do not need to alter the test file.
